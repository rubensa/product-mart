# ProductMart

Welcome to `product mart` this is an Angular App where we are using Angular Material to develop pages and we are making this app from the scratch to learn angular.

This course is introduction to `MEAN` stack step by step.
The `MEAN` stack uses `Mongo`, `Express`, `Angular` and `Node` for simple and scalable fullstack js applications
- [x] M = MONGO DB
- [x] E = EXPRESS
- [x] A = ANGULAR
- [x] N = NODE.JS

## Learning Checklist

Below are our learning checklist. We will cover one by one each topic while making this website and hence completing our `MEAN` Stack Learning.
Please follow all of my teaching videos here in YouTube.

- [x] ~~_Environment ( node, npm , expressjs, vscode )_~~ [2019-04-06]
- [x] ~~_Angular CLI_~~ [2019-04-06]
- [ ] Use Case (Display User List)
- [ ] Integrate with Angular Material
- [ ] Use Components from Angular Material
- [ ] Organize Project (shared and core module, feature module)
- [ ] Host application in local server ( express.js)
- [ ] Serve the data from local server

- [x] Articles related to `Angular` and related `MEAN` stacks can be found here in https://rupeshtiwari.com

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.
